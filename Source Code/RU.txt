HALLS:

The university has sixteen residential halls for students, five for women and eleven for men. The residential halls are named after prominent Bangladeshi historical and cultural figures, some of them from Rajshahi. The largest men's hall is Shahid Habibur Rahman Hall, named after a mathematics professor killed on campus during the 1971 war by the Pakistani Army. The largest women's hall is Monnujan Hall, followed by Begum Rokeya Hall, named after Rokeya Sakhawat Hussain, a leading figure in women's rights activism in Bengal.[citation needed] The housing system can accommodate 8,000 students, which has created a deepening accommodation crisis as the student body has risen to 25,000.Apart from the seat limitations, the amenities of these halls do not always meet decent accommodation standards.This has led to the establishment of many privately owned off-campus "messes". The residential halls provide meals, which are subsidised by the university authorities.
